## What is a Kalman Filter?

The Kalman Filter is an optimal estimation algorithm that combines multiple sensor measurements to produce the best possible estimate of a system's state. It's particularly powerful for sensor fusion in robotics.

### Key Concepts:

1. **State Estimation**: Estimates position, velocity, and orientation
2. **Uncertainty Modeling**: Tracks how confident we are in our estimates
3. **Prediction**: Uses motion model to predict next state
4. **Update**: Corrects predictions using sensor measurements
5. **Optimal Fusion**: Mathematically optimal way to combine sensors

## Sensor Fusion in This Experiment

### Input Sensors:
- **Wheel Encoders**: High accuracy position, low frequency
### Kalman Filter State Vector:
```
State = [x, y, vx, vy, theta, omega]
where:
  x, y     = Position coordinates
  vx, vy   = Linear velocities
  theta    = Orientation angle
  omega    = Angular velocity
```

## Distance Measurement Results

| Method | Distance (m) | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| Wheel Encoder | 24.660 | High | Primary navigation sensor |
| Kalman Fused | 24.766 | Optimized | Best of both sensors |

## Kalman Filter Algorithm Steps

### 1. Prediction Step
```python
# Predict next state based on motion model
x_predicted = F * x_previous  # F = state transition matrix
P_predicted = F * P * F.T + Q  # P = covariance, Q = process noise
```

### 2. Update Step
```python
# Correct prediction using sensor measurement
y = z - H * x_predicted      # Innovation (measurement residual)
S = H * P * H.T + R          # Innovation covariance
K = P * H.T * inv(S)         # Kalman gain
x_updated = x_predicted + K * y
P_updated = (I - K * H) * P
```

## Advantages of Kalman Filter

### Over Individual Sensors:
1. **Noise Reduction**: Filters out sensor noise
2. **Drift Compensation**: IMU drift corrected by wheel encoders
3. **Higher Frequency**: Can provide estimates at IMU rates
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence bounds
5. **Optimal**: Mathematically proven to be optimal under certain conditions

### Real-world Applications:
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPS + IMU + wheel encoders
- **Drones**: GPS + IMU + barometer + vision
- **Smartphones**: GPS + IMU + magnetometer
- **Robotics**: Multiple sensor fusion for navigation

## Implementation Notes

### Process Noise (Q matrix):
- Models uncertainty in motion model
- Higher values = trust sensors more than predictions
- Lower values = trust motion model more

### Measurement Noise (R matrix):
- Models sensor accuracy
- Wheel encoders: Low noise (accurate)
- IMU: Higher noise (less accurate)

### Tuning Parameters:
- **Q (Process Noise)**: Adjust based on motion model accuracy
- **R (Measurement Noise)**: Set based on sensor specifications
- **Initial Covariance P**: Set based on initial uncertainty

## Performance Analysis

- **Kalman vs Wheel Encoder**: 0.4% difference

## Conclusions

The Kalman filter provides an optimal way to combine multiple sensors, taking advantage of:
- Wheel encoder accuracy for position
- IMU high-frequency updates
- Mathematical optimality under Gaussian assumptions

This approach is essential for robust mobile robot navigation in real-world environments.
