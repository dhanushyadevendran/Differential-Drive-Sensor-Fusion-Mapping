# Differential-Drive-Sensor-Fusion-Mapping
This project simulates a differential drive robot in a Gazebo apartment-like environment to study odometry, trajectory tracking, and sensor fusion. Equipped with LiDAR and wheel encoders, the robot uses PD control to follow walls, completes a loop, and compares wheel and Kalman-filtered trajectories.
